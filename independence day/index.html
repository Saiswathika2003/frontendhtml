             Independence Day is a National Festival of India celebrated on the 15th of August. India became a free country on this day, and it’s only then we could secure our democratic rights as citizens of India. Our Independence gives us the reason to enjoy our fundamental rights laid down by the constitution. We are now a self-governed democratic country and have voting rights. The feeling of self-reliance and freedom fills the heart of the citizens with supreme happiness and joy. It is all due to the tireless efforts and numerous sacrifices of many great people who sacrificed their lives without fear.Every year on the 15th of August, India celebrates Independence Day. India became an independent country in the year 1947. Thus, a gazetted holiday is declared annually to commemorate this date. Each of us is born free, dies free, and wants to live free. India achieved its Independence with great struggle and effort. Several freedom fighters and many great men sacrificed their lives to achieve the nation’s freedom from the grip of British rule.

          	 In 1947, on 15th August, India became independent. We won freedom from British Raj after a hard struggle. On this day at the stroke of midnight, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister, unfurled the National Flag at the Red Fort for the first time. It marked the end of the 200 years old British reign in India. We now breathe air in a free and sovereign nation.The British have governed India for about 200 years. Under British colonisation, the life of every Indian was dismal and full of struggle. Indians were treated as slaves and had no freedom of speech. Indian rulers were puppets in the possession of British officers. Indian fighters were dealt with cruelty in British camps, and farmers were starving as they couldn't grow crops and needed to pay substantial land taxes.A wind of patriotism and national integration blows across the country on this day. The country is celebrating 77 Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav as it completes 76 years of independence to remind the citizens of the sacrifices made by our forefathers. Through Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, India will commemorate its past this Independence Day and will also lay plans for the future. It is now in the hands of India’s youth to shape and form the future of our country.

           	 India accomplished freedom following a 200-year-long battle. India gained complete independence from the British on 15th August 1947. That is why the day holds importance in the heart of each Indian citizen either living in India or abroad. India is celebrating 77 years of freedom on 15th August 2023 as Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. This day also helps us remember the struggles of freedom fighters and the lives sacrificed in attaining independence.The struggle that our freedom fighters have gone through shows us that the freedom we appreciate today has been attained by shedding the blood of hundreds of individuals. It stirs patriotism inside each Indian. It makes the current generation understand the struggles of individuals around them and familiarise themselves with the freedom fighters of India.
